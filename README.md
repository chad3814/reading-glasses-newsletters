# reading-glasses-newsletters
An archive of past newsletters from the podcast Reading Glasses

## Organization
Each newsletter issue should go into the `raw` directory and be named like `%04d-%d-%02d-%02d-%s` where the arguments are newsletter number, year, month, date it was sent and then a slug of the subject line. The extension should be appropriate to the content, so `.txt`, `.html`, or `.md`.

## Publishing
TBD, scripts written to transform the raw entries into something that is indexable and publishable
